	//Declare 2 index trackers and a fixed array with size of unsigned char.
	//This array will be our checking mechanism.
	//Unsigned char has range of 0-255.
	//Initialise array and fill with 0's.
	//Assign first index value of 1. This is to index the arguments.
	//Loop through argument characters 1 by 1.
	//If We havent stored a value in the array at the index position given by the value of the unsigned char from the argument.
	//We assign the array position a value of 1 and output the current character.
